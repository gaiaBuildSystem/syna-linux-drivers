config SERIAL_DSPG_UART
	tristate "DSPG UART support"
	select SERIAL_CORE
	help
	  This driver supports the DSPG UART port.

config SERIAL_DSPG_CONSOLE
	bool "Support for console on DSPG DW serial port"
	depends on SERIAL_DSPG_UART
	select SERIAL_CORE_CONSOLE
	select SERIAL_EARLYCON
	help
	  Say Y here if you wish to use DSPG DW UART as the system
	  console (the system console is the device which receives all kernel
	  messages and warnings and which allows logins in single user mode).

	  Even if you say Y here, the currently visible framebuffer console
	  (/dev/tty0) will still be used as the system console by default, but
	  you can alter that using a kernel command line option such as
	  "console=ttyDW0". (Try "man bootparam" or see the documentation of
	  your boot loader (lilo or loadlin) about how to pass options to the
	  kernel at boot time.)

config SERIAL_DSPG_TTYDW
	bool "Install as device ttyDWn instead of ttySn"
	depends on SERIAL_DSPG_UART=y
	help
	  Say Y here if you wish to have the internal DW UARTs
	  appear as /dev/ttyDWn (major 254, minor starting at 74)
	  instead of the normal /dev/ttySn (major 4, minor starting at
	  64). This is necessary if you also want other UARTs, such as
	  external 8250/16C550 compatible UARTs.
	  The ttySn nodes are legally reserved for the 8250 serial driver
	  but are often misused by other serial drivers.

	  To use this, you should create suitable ttyDWn device nodes in
	  /dev/, and pass "console=ttyDWn" to the kernel.

	  Say Y if you have an external 8250/16C550 UART.  If unsure, say N.

config SERIAL_DSPG_TDM_UART
	tristate "DSPG Software UART support"
	select SERIAL_CORE
	select DMW96_GDMAC
	help
	  This driver supports the DSPG software UART port via TDM.
